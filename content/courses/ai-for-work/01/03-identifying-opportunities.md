# Identifying AI Opportunities in Your Role

Now that you understand what AI can do, let's develop a framework for spotting opportunities to use AI in your specific role.

## The AI Opportunity Framework

Use these questions to identify where AI can help:

### 1. Time Analysis
- What tasks take up most of your time?
- Which activities are repetitive?
- Where do you experience bottlenecks?

### 2. Task Characteristics
- Which tasks follow predictable patterns?
- What work requires processing large amounts of information?
- Where do you need to generate variations of similar content?

### 3. Value Assessment
- Which time-consuming tasks have lower strategic value?
- Where would saved time create the most impact?
- What would you focus on if routine tasks were automated?

## Common AI Use Cases by Role
